    "Flatiron Health Insurance (FHI) is a growing private healthcare insurance provider founded on the premise that using data and analytics can improve the health insurance industry by providing better care and offerings to its patients. Every year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) conducts surveys to understand the latest demographic, health, and fitness trends. You have been tasked with analyzing the recently published results of the 2017-2018 survey and providing your recommendations back to the Chief Analytics Officer and Chief Marketing Officer. You have been assigned the task of taking a first look at the data and beginning to answer several key questions:\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "1. How does health status, represented by average number of days with bad physical health in the past month (`PHYSHLTH`), differ by state?\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "2. Digging deeper into the data, what are some factors that impact health (demographics, behaviors, etc.)?\t\n",

    "To get you started, the IT department formatted the data set into a tab delimited text file for only NY, NJ, and CT (FHI’s primary markets) called `case_study.csv`.\n",

    "There is also a PDF data dictionary called `data_dictionary.pdf`, which explains the meanings of the features and codes contained in this dataset.\n",

    "Prior to each statistical test, you will need to perform some data preparation, which could include:\n",

    "* Filtering out rows with irrelevant values\n",
    "* Transforming data from codes into human-readable values\n",
    "* Binning data to transform it from numeric to categorical\n",
    "* Creating new columns based on queries of the values in other columns\n",
    "\n",
    "For steps 2-5, you will need to select and execute an appropriate statistical test. Recall these tests we have learned so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Chi-squared test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html): used for comparing a categorical feature against a categorical feature, to determine whether they are independent\n",
    "2. [t-test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html): used for comparing two categories of a numeric feature, to determine whether their means are the same across categories\n",
    "3. [ANOVA](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm.html#statsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm): used for comparing more than two categories of a numeric feature, to determine whether their means are the same across categories"
